# Kraft, Kyle - Project 3.1 Lyrics

#The purpose of this script is to practice using Functions in a script.
#Here I will print the lyrics to Green Day's Basketcase while substituting
# the chours with a function that calls the necessary lyrics.

#First I'll start by defining the chorus. It's important to remember that python expects
# all commands inside a fuction to be indented.
def chorus():
    print("Sometimes I give myself the creeps")
    print("Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me")
    print("It all keeps adding up")
    print("I think I'm cracking up")
    print("Am I just paranoid")
    print("Or am I just stoned?")

#Now we'll just print out the lyrics like normal. 
print "Do you have the time to listen to me whine"
print("About nothing and everything all at once?")
print("I am one of those")
print("Melodramatic fools")
print("Neurotic to the bone")
print("No doubt about it")

print("I went to a shrink")
print("To analyze my dremams")
print("She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down")
print("I went to a whore")
print("He said my lives a bore")
print("So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down")
